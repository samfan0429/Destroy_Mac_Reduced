# Destroy_Mac_Reduced
This is a reduced version of Destroy Mac in order figure out the bug behind Phaser 3 in using the keyboard and the system. The system thinks the velocity is still maintained even after the scene change without pressing the button. Even if I put velocity to false, the velocity is not zero after transition.
